                    The Temir group carries out basic and applied research with the goal of developing future information systems. Working at the intersection of natural language processing and information retrieval, our focus is on societal challenges concerning quality and trustworthiness of information. Results are integrated into large-scale information systems, making use of crowdsourcing, data mining, machine learning, high-performance computing, and web technologies.</p>
