                        Information on the web is growing at an exponential pace, courtesy of social media platforms, blogs, and news. Such large scale data sources call for high-end, scalable, distributed architectures for cognitive analysis, which shape the business decisions of many industries. In addition, deep learning has been propelled into mainstream and is now accessible to researchers and companies alike, thanks to tools such as TensorFlow, PyTorch. The Webis research group operates large-scale high-performance compute infrastructure (totaling more than 3000 CPU cores, 10+ Petabytes of storage, and 24 high-end GPUs), which will be put to use in the course of this seminar. Students will receive application-oriented training in Big data and deep learning frameworks, language technologies, and explore interesting research questions. This seminar requires good skills in both programming (Python) and algorithms.

                        Please note that this course requires prior Python programming experience. In addition, some familiarity with Linux environments, and knowledge of machine learning basics, is highly recommended. To help you gauge your prior subject knowledge, we've provided a set of self-assessment questions below. Read through the self-assessment questions, and take note of how many you can answer in the affirmative, and how many answers you know without having to look them up.

		  <li>We decided to increase our capacities and accept all students from the <a href="https://www.mathcs.uni-leipzig.de/studium/studienorganisation/moduleinschreibung">waiting list</a> <b>if they meet the requirements above</b>. As we would like to start the lecture as planned, please contact <a href="https://temir.org/people.html#deckers">Niklas Deckers</a> asap if you didn't receive the welcome email yet. Sending it out to everyone on the waiting list would only be possible for the Studienb√ºro, which is currently overloaded and will probably do this after the lecture started.</li>
		  <li>We sent out an AlmaWeb verification email. If you didn't receive this one, this means that you are not enrolled in the course. Please contact <a href="https://temir.org/people.html#deckers">Niklas Deckers</a> asap in this case.</li>

		<li><b>General Note</b> This is a joint seminar between Uni Weimar and Uni Leipzig. We will use our camera equipment to link both seminars.</li>
		<li><b>Leipzig-specific Remark</b> This course will have to be credited as Citizen Science on your transcripts as it represents a topic-wise variation of that course. This also means that it cannot be credited twice if you already completed Citizen Science.</li>
