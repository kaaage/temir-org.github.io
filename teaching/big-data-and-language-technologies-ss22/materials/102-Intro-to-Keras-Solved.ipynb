    "... may feel basic if you've done statistical modeling or machine learning before. Don't worry, we will progress to more in-depth topics â€“ these first sessions are thought to get everyone, regardless of their background and prior experience on the same level.\n",
    "\n",
    "... is divided into three steps:\n",
    "1. Load and preprocess the IMDB dataset\n",
    "2. Build a basic TensorFlow model using the Keras API\n",
    "3. Evaluate and select the best model and perform inference on unseen data\n",
    "\n",
    "... assumes three things:\n",
    "1. You have successfully completed the `101-Setup.md` guide and thus have a working environment with all dependencies installed\n",
    "2. You understand the basics of neural machine learning, with concepts like neurons, activation functions, loss functions, and optimization strategies\n",
    "3. You work in a UNIX-based environment (Linux, MacOS); if you're on Windows, you might need to adapt shell commands to your specific case\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "... is organized as follows: each block of code cells is prefaced with a text cell containing a general explanation, then an **Exercise** (describing what is to be achieved in the following code cells), and optionally *Notes* (providing hints for the solution). Code cells might already contain some comments to help you along the way."

    "#### Embedding Layer\n",
    "A `Sequential` model behaves much like a list of layers: we can append to it using the `keras.Sequential.add` function, which takes the to-be-added layer as argument. First, we are going to add an input `Embedding` layer to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "An `Embedding` layer turns positive integers (the term index in our document sequences) into dense vectors of fixed size. For example, we can turn a sequence of two indices into a two-dimensional vector of size two each: \n",

    "$$ \\begin{bmatrix}4 & 20\\end{bmatrix} \\rightarrow \\begin{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}0.25\\\\0.1 \\\\\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}0.6\\\\-0.2 \\\\\\end{bmatrix}\\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, why do we need it? There are two reasons our `Sequential` model begins with an `Embedding` layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first is that we want to build a semantic representation of words, i.e. a vector space in which the distance between words relates to their semantic closeness. This is what the `Embedding` layer does: it transforms the discrete (word index) input space into a dense continuous vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second reason is efficiency. The model cannot operate term indices directly, but instead needs a vectorized input. One option would be to use one-hot encoding to represent each index as a vector. For example, the index `44` in a vocabulary of 500 terms would be turned into a vector of 500 zeroes where the 44th place is a one. This leaves us with a vector representation that is both of extremely high dimensionality and extremely sparse - both are inefficient. The `Embedding` layer increases the efficiency by using much smaller, dense vectors. The index `44` can now be represented as a 16-dimension vector with continous, dense values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Taking both together, the `Embedding` layer increases both the efficiency and effectiveness of our network.\n",

In our case, we are going to use a `GlobalAveragePooling1D` layer: it calculates the average over one dimension of the input, collapsing it to a single number.

To understand the concepts introduced in this step, recall the well-known [mountain-descent metaphor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent#An_analogy_for_understanding_gradient_descent) for model training: you're on top of a mountain and try to get down (find the local minimum). But since there is heavy fog, you can only see your immediate surroundings. The gradient descent strategy would be to see where in your visible surroundings the descent down the mountain is steepest and move there.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. A **Loss** function: the loss function is used to quantify the errors made during the learning process. Simply put, the lower the output value of the loss function, the better performing the model is; the training process therefore aims to *minimize* the loss. In the mountain-descent example, the loss indicates your current elevation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An **Optimizer**: the optimizer strategy is used to calculate the direction and magnitude of parameter updates during gradient descent. In the mountain-descent example, the optimizer is how you detect where to move next.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A validation **Metric**: a metric is used to quantify the quality of the models predictions. While the loss quantifies the goodness-of-fit of the model parameters, the metric is calculated only on the output predictions of the model.\n",
