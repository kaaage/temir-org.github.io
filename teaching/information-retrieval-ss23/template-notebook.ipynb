    "- (2) Corresponding explanation cells: Each code cell must be followed by a text cell containing the **english** explanation of what the corresponding code cell does and what it's purpose is\n",
    "- (3) One reflection cell: One cell at the bottom of the notebook that contains your individual reflection on your process working on this milestones in **english**. It could contain technical problems and how you overcame them, it could contain social problems and how you deal with them (group work is hard!), it could contain explanations of prior skills or knowledge that made certain parts of the task easier for you, etc... (those are just suggestions. Your individual reflections will of course contain different/additional aspects)"
