    "### Micro- and Macro-Averaging\n",
    "\n",
    "For multiclass settings, since true/false positives/negatives are only defined *per class*, evaluation scores are also inutitively per-class only. The question thus becomes how scores can be aggregated across classes. Two options exist: micro- and macro-averaging. \n",
    "\n",
    "In micro-averaging, we collect the decisions for all classes into a single confusion matrix, adding the true/false positive/negative rates over all classes, and then compute precision and recall from that matrix. In macro-averaging, we compute a metric for each class separately, and then average the  computed values over all classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Micro-averaging takes class imbalance into account in the sense that the resulting performance is based on the proportion of every class, i.e. the performance of a large class has more impact on the result than of a small class. Macro-averaging doesn't take imbalance into account in the sense that the resulting performance is a simple average over the classes, so every class is given equal weight independently from their proportion."
